# Malware
* **Malware**
    * **Malware**
        * Software designed to infiltrate a computer system and possibly damage it without the user’s knowledge or consent
            * Viruses
            * Worms
            * Trojan horses
            * Ransomware
            * Spyware
            * Rootkits
            * Spam
* **Viruses**
    * **Virus**
        * Malicious code that runs on a machine without the user’s knowledge and infects the computer when executed
        * Viruses require a user action in order to reproduce and spread
            * Boot sector
                * Boot sector viruses are stored in the first sector of a hard drive and are loaded into memory upon boot up
            * Macro
                * Virus embedded into a document and is executed when the document is opened by the user
            * Program
                * Program viruses infect an executable or application
            * Multipartite
                * Virus that combines boot and program viruses to first attach itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer
            * Encrypted
            * Polymorphic
                * Advanced version of an encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection
            * Metamorphic
                * Virus that is able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a file (advanced version of polymorphic virus)
            * Stealth
            * Armored
                * Armored viruses have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it
            * Hoax
* **Worms**
    * **Worm**
        * Malicious software, like a virus, but is able to replicate itself without user interaction
        * Worms self-replicate and spread without a user’s consent or action
        * Worms can cause disruption to normal network traffic and computing activities
        * Example
            * 2009: 9-15 million computers infected with conficker
* **Trojans**
    * Trojan Horse
        * Malicious software that is disguised as a piece of harmless or desirable
        software
        * Trojans perform desired functions and malicious functions
    * Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
        * Provides the attacker with remote control of a victim computer and is the most commonly used type of Trojan
* **Ransomware**
    * Ransomware
        * Malware that restricts access to a victim’s computer system until a ransom is received
        * Ransomware uses a vulnerability in your software to gain access and then encrypts your files
        * Example
            * $17 million: SamSam cost the City of Atlanta
* **Spyware**
    * Spyware
        * Malware that secretly gathers information about the user without their
        consent
        * Captures keystrokes made by the victim and takes screenshots that are sent to the attacker
    * Adware
        * Displays advertisements based upon its spying on you
    * Grayware
        * Software that isn’t benign nor malicious and tends to behave improperly without serious consequences
* **Rootkits**
    * Rootkit
        * Software designed to gain administrative level control over a system without detection
        * DLL injection is commonly used by rootkits to maintain their persistent control
    * DLL Injection
        * Malicious code is inserted into a running process on a Windows machine by taking advantage of Dynamic Link Libraries that are loaded at runtime
    * Driver Manipulation
        * An attack that relies on compromising the kernel-mode device drivers that operate at a privileged or system level
        * A shim is placed between two components to intercept calls and redirect them
    * Rootkits are activated before booting the operating system and are difficult to detect
* **Spam**
    * **Spam**
        * Activity that abuses electronic messaging systems, most commonly through email
        * Spammers often exploit a company’s open mail relays to send their messages
        * CAN-SPAM Act of 2003
* **Summary of Malware**
    * **Virus**
        * Code that infects a computer when a file is opened or executed
    * **Worm**
        * Acts like a virus but can self-replicate
    * **Trojan**
        * Appears to do a desired function but also does something malicious
    * **Ransomware**
        * Takes control of your computer or data unless you pay
    * **Spyware**
        * Software that collects your information without your consent
    * **Rootkit**
        * Gains administrative control of your system by targeting boot loader or kernel
    * **Spam**
        * Abuse of electronic messaging systems
