Physical Security
• Physical Security
o If an attacker can physically touch your devices, they can own your devices
• Surveillance
o Closed Circuit TV (CCTV)
o Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ)
• Door Locks
o Door locks can use keys, pins, wireless signals, or biometrics
o Mantrap
▪ Area between two doorways that holds people until they are identified
and authenticated
• Biometric Readers
o Biometrics
▪ Relies on the physical characteristics of a person to identify them
▪ Biometrics is considered “something you are”
o False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
▪ Rate that a system authenticates a user as authorized or valid when they
should not have been granted access to the system
o False Rejection Rate (FRR)
▪ Rate that a system denies a user as authorized or valid when they should
have been granted access to the system
o Crossover Error Rate (CER)
▪ An equal error rate (ERR) where the false acceptance rate and false
rejection rate are equal
▪ CER measures the effectiveness of a biometric system
