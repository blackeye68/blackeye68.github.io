o Fire Suppression
▪ Process of controlling and/or extinguishing fires to protect an
organization’s employees, data, equipment, and buildings
o Handheld
▪ Class A, B, C, D, K
o Sprinklers
▪ Wet Pipe Sprinkler System
• Pipes are filled with water all the way to the sprinkler head and
are just waiting for the bulb to be melted or broken
▪ Dry Pipe Sprinkler System
• Pipes are filled with pressurized air and only push water into
the pipes when needed to combat the fire
▪ A pre-action sprinkler system will activate when heat or smoke is
detected
o Special Hazard Protection

• Fire suppression system that relies upon gas (HALON, FM-200, or
CO2) instead of water to extinguish a fire
o If you hear a loud alarm in the server room… GET OUT!
• HVAC
o HVAC
▪ Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
o Humidity should be kept around 40%
o HVAC systems may be connected to ICS and SCADA networks
• Shielding
o Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) adds a layer of shielding inside the cable
o Faraday Cage
▪ Shielding installed around an entire room that prevents electromagnetic
energy and radio frequencies from entering or leaving the room
o TEMPEST
▪ U.S. Government standards for the level of shielding required in a
building to ensure emissions and interference cannot enter or exit the
facility
▪ TEMPEST facilities are also resistant to EMPs (electromagnetic pulses)
• Vehicles
o Controller Area Network (CAN)
▪ Connects all of a car’s systems together in order for them to
communicate effectively
o Air Gap
▪ A method of isolating an entity to effectively separate it from everything
else
o Your security policies must consider the company’s vehicles
