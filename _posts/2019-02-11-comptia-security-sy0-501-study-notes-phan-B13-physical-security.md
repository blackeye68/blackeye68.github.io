# Physical Security
* **Physical Security**
    * **If an attacker can physically touch your devices, they can own your devices**

* **Surveillance**
    * **Closed Circuit TV (CCTV)**
    * **Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ)**

* **Door Locks**
    * **Door locks can use keys, pins, wireless signals, or biometrics**
    * **Mantrap**
        * Area between two doorways that holds people until they are identified and authenticated

* **Biometric Readers**
    * **Biometrics**
        * Relies on the physical characteristics of a person to identify them
        * Biometrics is considered “something you are”
    * **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**
        * Rate that a system authenticates a user as authorized or valid when they should not have been granted access to the system
    * **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**
        * Rate that a system denies a user as authorized or valid when they should have been granted access to the system
    * **Crossover Error Rate (CER)**
        * An equal error rate (ERR) where the false acceptance rate and false rejection rate are equal
        * CER measures the effectiveness of a biometric system
