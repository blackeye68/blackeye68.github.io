# Facilities Security
* **Facility Security**
* **Fire Suppression**
    * Fire Suppression
        * Process of controlling and/or extinguishing fires to protect an
    organization’s employees, data, equipment, and buildings
    * Handheld
        * Class A, B, C, D, K
    * Sprinklers
        * Wet Pipe Sprinkler System
            * Pipes are filled with water all the way to the sprinkler head and
            are just waiting for the bulb to be melted or broken
        * Dry Pipe Sprinkler System
            * Pipes are filled with pressurized air and only push water into
            the pipes when needed to combat the fire
        * A pre-action sprinkler system will activate when heat or smoke is
        detected
    * Special Hazard Protection
        * Clean Agent System
            * Fire suppression system that relies upon gas (HALON, FM-200, or
            CO2) instead of water to extinguish a fire
    * If you hear a loud alarm in the server room… GET OUT!

* HVAC
    * HVAC
        * Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
    * Humidity should be kept around 40%
    * HVAC systems may be connected to ICS and SCADA networks

* Shielding
    * Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) adds a layer of shielding inside the cable
    * Faraday Cage
        * Shielding installed around an entire room that prevents electromagnetic
        energy and radio frequencies from entering or leaving the room
    * TEMPEST
        * U.S. Government standards for the level of shielding required in a
        building to ensure emissions and interference cannot enter or exit the
        facility
        * TEMPEST facilities are also resistant to EMPs (electromagnetic pulses)

* Vehicles
    * Controller Area Network (CAN)
        * Connects all of a car’s systems together in order for them to
        communicate effectively
    * Air Gap
        * A method of isolating an entity to effectively separate it from everything
        else
    * Your security policies must consider the company’s vehicles
