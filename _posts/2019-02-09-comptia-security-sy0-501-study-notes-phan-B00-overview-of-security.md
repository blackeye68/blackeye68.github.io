        * Act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction
    * **Information Systems Security**
        * Act of protecting the systems that hold and process our critical data
    * **Basics and Fundamentals**
* **CIA Triad**

    * **Confidentiality**
        * Information has not been disclosed to unauthorized people
    * **Integrity**
        * Information has not been modified or altered without proper authorization
    * **Availability**
        * Information is able to be stored, accessed, or protected at all times
* **AAA of Security**
    * **Authentication**
        * When a person’s identity is established with proof and confirmed by a system
            * Something you know
            * Something you are
            * Something you have
            * Something you do
            * Somewhere you are
    * **Authorization**
        * Occurs when a user is given access to a certain piece of data or certain areas of a building
    * **Accounting**
        * Tracking of data, computer usage, and network resources
        * Non-repudiation occurs when you have proof that someone has taken an action
* **Security Threats**
    * **Malware**
        * Short-hand term for malicious software
    * **Unauthorized Access**
        * Occurs when access to computer resources and data occurs without the consent of the owner
    * **System Failure**
        * Occurs when a computer crashes or an individual application fails
    * **Social Engineering**
        * Act of manipulating users into revealing confidential information or performing other detrimental actions
* **Mitigating Threats**
    * **Physical Controls**
        * Alarm systems, locks, surveillance cameras, identification cards, and security guards
    * **Technical Controls**
        * Smart cards, encryption, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection systems, and network authentication
    * **Administrative Controls**
        * Policies, procedures, security awareness training, contingency planning, and disaster recovery plans
        * User training is the most cost-effective security control to use
* **Hackers**
    * **Five Types of Hackers**
        * White Hats
            * Non-malicious hackers who attempt to break into a company’s systems at their request
        * Black Hats
            * Malicious hackers who break into computer systems and networks without authorization or permission
        * Gray Hats
            * Hackers without any affiliation to a company who attempt to break into a company’s network but risk the law by doing so
        * Blue Hats
            * Hackers who attempt to hack into a network with permission of the company but are not employed by the company
        * Elite
            * Hackers who find and exploit vulnerabilities before anyone else does
            * 1 in 10,000 are elite
    * **Script kiddies have limited skill and only run other people’s exploits and tools**
* **Threat Actors**
    * **Script Kiddies**
        * Hackers with little to no skill who only use the tools and exploits written by others
    * **Hacktivists**
        * Hackers who are driven by a cause like social change, political agendas, or terrorism
    * **Organized Crime**
        * Hackers who are part of a crime group that is well-funded and highly sophisticated
    * **Advanced Persistent Threats**
        * Highly trained and funded groups of hackers (often by nation states) with covert and open-source intelligence at their disposal
