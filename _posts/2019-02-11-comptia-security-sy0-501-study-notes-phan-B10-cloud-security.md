Cloud Security
• Cloud Computing
o Cloud Computing
▪ A way of offering on-demand services that extend the traditional
capabilities of a computer or network
▪ Cloud computing relies on virtualization to gain efficiencies and cost
savings
o Hyperconvergence allows providers to fully integrate the storage, network, and
servers
o Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
▪ VDI allows a cloud provider to offer a full desktop operating system to an
end user from a centralized server
o Secure Enclaves and Secure Volumes
• Cloud Types
o Public Cloud
▪ A service provider makes resources available to the end users over the
Internet
o Private Cloud
▪ A company creates its own cloud environment that only it can utilize as
an internal enterprise resource
▪ A private cloud should be chosen when security is more important than
cost
o Hybrid
o Community Cloud
▪ Resources and costs are shared among several different organizations
who have common service needs
• As a Service
o Software as a Service (SaaS)
▪ Provides all the hardware, operating system, software, and applications
needed for a complete service to be delivered
o Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
▪ Provides all the hardware, operating system, and backend software
needed in order to develop your own software or service
o Platform as a Service (PaaS)
▪ Provides your organization with the hardware and software needed for a
specific service to operate
o Security as a Service (SECaaS)
▪ Provides your organization with various types of security services without
the need to maintain a cybersecurity staff
▪ Anti-malware solutions were one of the first SECaaS products
o Some solutions may not scan all the files on your system
o Cloud-based vulnerability scans can better provide the attacker’s perspective
o Your vulnerability data may be stored on the cloud provider’s server
o Sandboxing
▪ Utilizes separate virtual networks to allow security professionals to test
suspicious or malicious files
o Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
o Continuous Monitoring
o Access Control
o Identity Management
o Business Continuity
o Disaster Recovery
• Cloud Security
o Collocated data can become a security risk
o Configure, manage, and audit user access to virtualized servers
o Utilizing the cloud securely requires good security policies
o Data remnants may be left behind after deprovisioning
• Defending Servers
o File Servers
▪ Servers are used to store, transfer, migrate, synchronize, and archive files
for your organization
o Email servers are a frequent target of attacks for the data they hold
o Web servers should be placed in your DMZ
o FTP Server
▪ A specialized type of file server that is used to host files for distribution
across the web
▪ FTP servers should be configured to require TLS connections
o Domain Controller
▪ A server that acts as a central repository of all the user accounts and their
associated passwords for the network
o Active Directory is targeted for privileged escalation and lateral movement
