# Mobile Device Security
* **Mobile Device Security**
* **Securing Wireless Devices**
    * **WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) is the highest level of wireless security**
    * **AES**
        * Advanced Encryption Standard
    * **Bluetooth pairing creates a shared link key to encrypt the connection**
    * **Wired devices are almost always more secure than wireless ones**
* **Mobile Malware**
    * **Ensure your mobile device is patched and updated**
    * **Only install apps from the official App Store or Play Store**
    * **Do not jailbreak/root device**
    * **Don’t use custom firmware or a custom ROM**
    * **Only load official store apps**
    * **Always update your phone’s operating system**
* **SIM Cloning & ID Theft**
    * **Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)**
        * Integrated circuit that securely stores the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key
    * **SIM Cloning**
        * Allows two phones to utilize the same service and allows an attacker to gain access to the phone’s data
        * SIM v1 cards were easy to clone but newer SIM v2 cards are much harder
        * Be careful with where you post phone numbers
* **Bluetooth Attacks**
    * **Bluejacking**
        * Sending of unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices
    * **Bluesnarfing**
        * Unauthorized access of information from a wireless device over a
        Bluetooth connection
    * **Bluejacking sends information to a device**
    * **Bluesnarfing takes information from a device**
* **Mobile Device Theft**
    * **Always ensure your device is backed up**
    * **Don’t try to recover your device alone if it is stolen**
    * **Remote Lock**
        * Requires a PIN or password before someone can use the device
    * **Remote Wipe**
        * Remotely erases the contents of the device to ensure the information is

* **Security of Apps**
    * **Only install apps from the official mobile stores**
    * **TLS**
        * Transport Layer Security
    * **Mobile Device Management**
        * Centralized software solution that allows system administrators to create
        and enforce policies across its mobile devices
    * **Turn location services off to ensure privacy**
    * **Geotagging**
        * Embedding of the geolocation coordinates into a piece of data (i.e., a

    * **Geotagging should be considered when developing your organization’s security policies**
* **Bring Your Own Device**
    * **BYOD introduces a lot of security issues to consider**
    * **Storage Segmentation**
        * Creating a clear separation between personal and company data on a
        single device
    * **Mobile Device Management**
        * Centralized software solution for remote administration and
        configuration of mobile devices
    * **CYOD**
        * Choose Your Own Device
    * **MDM can prevent certain applications from being installed on the device**
    * **Ensure your organization has a good security policy for mobile devices**
* **Hardening Mobile Devices**
    1. Update your device to the latest version of the software
    2. Install AntiVirus
    3. Train users on proper security and use of the device
    4. Only install apps from the official mobile stores
    5. Do not root or jailbreak your devices
    6. Only use v2 SIM cards with your devices
    7. Turn off all unnecessary features
