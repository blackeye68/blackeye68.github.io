# Malware Infections
* **Malware Infection**
    * Threat Vector
        * Method used by an attacker to access a victim’s machine

        * Method used by an attacker to gain access to a victim’s machine in order to infect it with malware
* **Common Delivery Methods**
    * Malware infections usually start within software, messaging, and media
    * Watering Holes
        * Malware is placed on a website that you know your potential victims will access

        * Botnets can be utilized in other processor intensive functions and
        activities
* **Active Interception & Privilege Escalation**
    * Active Interception
        * Occurs when a computer is placed between the sender and receiver and is able to capture or modify the traffic between themo Privilege Escalation

        * Occurs when you are able to exploit a design flaw or bug in a system to gain access to resources that a normal user isn’t able to access
* **Backdoors and Logic Bombs**
    * Backdoors are used to bypass normal security and authentication functions
    * Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is placed by an attacker to maintain persistent access
    * Logic Bomb
        * Malicious code that has been inserted inside a program and will execute only when certain conditions have been met
    * Easter Egg
        * Non-malicious code that when invoked, displays an insider joke, hidden message, or secret feature
    * Logic bombs and Easter eggs should not be used according to secure coding standards
* **Symptoms of Infection**
    * Your computer might have been infected if it begins to act strangely
        * Hard drives, files, or applications are not accessible anymore
        * Strange noises occur
        * Unusual error messages

        * System Restore will not function
* **Removing Malware**
    * Identify symptoms of a malware infection
    * Quarantine the infected systems
    * Disable System Restore (if using a Windows machine)
    * Remediate the infected system
    * Schedule automatic updates and scans
    * Enable System Restore and create a new restore point
    * Provide end user security awareness training
    * If a boot sector virus is suspected, reboot the computer from an external device and scan it
* **Preventing Malware**
    * Viruses
    * Worms
    * Trojans
    * Ransomware
    * Spyware
    * Rootkits
    * Spam
    * Worms, Trojans, and Ransomware are best detected with anti-malware solutions
    * Scanners can detect a file containing a rootkit before it is installed…
    * …removal of a rootkit is difficult and the best plan is to reimage the machine
    * Verify your email servers aren’t configured as open mail relays or SMTP open relays
    * Remove email addresses from website
    * Use whitelists and blacklists
    * Train and educate end users
        * Update your anti-malware software automatically and scan your computer
        * Update and patch the operating system and applications regularly
