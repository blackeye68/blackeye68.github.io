# Securing Networks
• Securing Networks
    o Wired and wireless networks are vulnerable to attacks
• Securing Network Devices
o Network devices include switches, routers, firewalls, and more
o Default Accounts
▪ A user or administrator-level account that is installed on a device by the
manufacturer during production
o Weak Passwords
▪ A password should be long, strong, and complex. This should require at
least 14 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and
special characters
• password
• PaSSworD
• Pa55w0rd
• P@$5w0rd
o Privilege Escalation
▪ Occurs when a user is able to gain the rights of another user or
administrator
▪ Vertical Privilege Escalation
▪ Horizontal Privilege Escalation
o Backdoor
▪ A way of bypassing normal authentication in a system
o An IPS, proper firewall configs, network segmentation, and firmware updates
are the keys to having network security
• Securing Network Media
o Network Media
▪ Copper, fiber optic, and coaxial cabling used as the connectivity method
in a wired network
o Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
▪ A disturbance that can affect electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to
radiation or electromagnetic conduction
▪ EMI can be caused by TVs, microwaves, cordless phones, motors, and
other devices
▪ Shielding the cables (STP) or the source can minimize EMI
o Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
▪ A disturbance that can affect electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to
AM/FM transmissions or cell towers
▪ RFI causes more problems for wireless networks
o Crosstalk
▪ Occurs when a signal transmitted on one copper wire creates an
undesired effect on another wire
▪ UTP is commonly used more often than STP
o Data Emanation
▪ The electromagnetic field generated by a network cable or device when
transmitting
▪ A Faraday cage can be installed to prevent a room from emanating
▪ Split the wires of a twisted-pair connection
o Protected Distribution System (PDS)
▪ Secured system of cable management to ensure that the wired network
remains free from eavesdropping, tapping, data emanations, and other
threats
• Securing WiFi Devices
o Service Set Identifier (SSID)
▪ Uniquely identifies the network and is the name of the WAP used by the
clients
▪ Disable the SSID broadcast in the exam
o Rogue Access Point
▪ An unauthorized WAP or Wireless Router that allows access to the secure
network
o Evil Twin
▪ A rogue, counterfeit, and unauthorized WAP with the same SSID as your
valid one
• Wireless Encryption
o Encryption of data in transit is paramount to security
o Pre-Shared Key
▪ Same encryption key is used by the access point and the client
o Wired Equivalent Privacy
▪ Original 802.11 wireless security standard that claims to be as secure as a
wired network
▪ WEP’s weakness is its 24-bit IV (Initialization Vector)
o WiFi Protected Access (WPA)
▪ Replacement for WEP which uses TKIP, Message Integrity Check (MIC),
and RC4 encryption
▪ WPA was flawed, so it was replaced by WPA2
o WiFi Protected Access version 2 (WPA2)
▪ 802.11i standard to provide better wireless security featuring AES with a
128-bit key, CCMP, and integrity checking
▪ WPA2 is considered the best wireless encryption available
o If we make operations easier, then security is reduced
o WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)
▪ Automated encryption setup for wireless networks at a push of a button,
but is severely flawed and vulnerable
▪ Always disable WPS
o Encryption and VPNs are always a good idea
• Wireless Access Points
o Wireless security also relies upon proper WAP placement
o Wireless B, G, and N use a 2.4 GHz signal
o Wireless A, N, and AC use a 5.0 GHz signal
o 2.4 GHz signals can travel further than 5 GHz
o Jamming
▪ Intentional radio frequency interference targeting your wireless network
to cause a denial of service condition
▪ Wireless site survey software and spectrum analyzers can help identify
jamming and interference
o AP Isolation
▪ Creates network segment for each client when it connects to prevent
them from communicating with other clients on the network
• Wireless Attacks
o War Driving
▪ Act of searching for wireless networks by driving around until you find
them
▪ Attackers can use wireless survey or open source attack tools
o War Chalking
▪ Act of physically drawing symbols in public places to denote the open,
closed, and protected networks in range
▪ War chalking digitally is becoming more commonplace
o IV Attack
▪ Occurs when an attacker observes the operation of a cipher being used
with several different keys and finds a mathematical relationship
between those keys to determine the clear text data
▪ This happened with WEP and makes it easy to crack
o WiFi Disassociation Attack
▪ Attack that targets an individual client connected to a network, forces it
offline by deauthenticating it, and then captures the handshake when it
reconnects
▪ Used as part of an attack on WPA/WPA2
o Brute Force Attack
▪ Occurs when an attacker continually guesses a password until the correct
one is found
▪ Brute force will always find the password…eventually!
• Other Wireless Technologies
o Bluejacking
▪ Sending of unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as
mobile phones and tablets
o Bluesnarfing
▪ Unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a
Bluetooth connection
o Bluejacking sends information
o Bluesnarfing takes information
o Don’t allow Bluetooth devices to use default PINs for pairing
o Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
▪ Devices that use a radio frequency signal to transmit identifying
information about the device or token holder
▪ RFID can operate from 10 cm to 200 meters depending on the device
o Near Field Communication (NFC)
▪ Allows two devices to transmit information when they are within close
range through automated pairing and transmission
▪ NFC devices are op
